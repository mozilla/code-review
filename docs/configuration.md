# Configuration

The whole project uses [Taskcluster secrets](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/using/secrets) as a source of configuration.
We use a shared secret amongst every actor of the system, with a hierarchy so that common configurations can be easily shared without duplication.

The source code to manage secrets is in the [Taskcluster python library](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/blob/master/clients/client-py/taskcluster/helper.py) itself.

A developer can also specify its local configuration using a YAML file, with the same exact structure as the secret described below.

We use one secret per environment, on the firefox-ci Taskcluster instance:

- `project/relman/code-review/runtime-testing` for the testing environment
- `project/relman/code-review/runtime-production` for the production environment

## Sample commented file

```yaml
# Configuration under the `common` key is shared across the 3 other Python projects (bot, backend & events)
common:

  # This defines the environment name, used to customize logging, reporting, ...
  # Usual choices are: `testing`, `production` or `localdev`, `dev`
  APP_CHANNEL: testing

  # This section defines the optional statistics connection for an InfluxDB database.
  # This system is used and deployed by Mozilla Cloudops team.
  # Of course, it must be disabled on local configurations.
  influxdb:
    ssl: true
    password: xxxx
    username: yyyy
    database: zzzz
    port: 8086
    host: something.influxcloud.net

  # These two keys allow the project to log everything on Papertrail, so that administrators can troubleshoot the system.
  # For more information, see the debugging documentation.
  # Of course, it must be disabled on local configurations.

  PAPERTRAIL_PORT: 12345

  # A common Phabricator account is shared across the bot and events projects
  # Issues will be published with this account
