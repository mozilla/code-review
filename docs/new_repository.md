# How to hook up a new repository

## Requirements

1. Your repository must use [Mozilla Phabricator's instance](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/)
2. Your repository must use [Taskcluster as CI](https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/) (at least one task must start on each push).
3. You are adding a Taskcluster task that runs on each push, analyzes the modified source code and lists potential issues.
